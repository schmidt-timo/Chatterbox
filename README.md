# Chatterbox
Establish a connection between a server and a client (for chatting with each other)

Required exercises:

1.) Start your chatterbox by writing a method that listens on a port. 
The ports 8000 to 8010 are open for the lab network. This is your chatterbox server.

2.) Now write a client that writes to that port.

3.) Test your methods on your own machine. For now, just echo what you have read to the console to see it working. 
Now publish your computer name and port number on the board in the lab.
Start chatting with a few of your neighbors! Describe what works and does not work.
